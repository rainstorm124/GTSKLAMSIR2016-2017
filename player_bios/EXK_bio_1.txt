Born in the 1890s in a small village in the Smolensk Oblast.You and your family lived on a small independent plot that you tended, and leveraged to gain more wealth for yourself.. When the collectivization drive started in 1928, you and your family were rather reluctant to give up plot and join a collective, but you felt you didn&apos;t have much of a choice.
