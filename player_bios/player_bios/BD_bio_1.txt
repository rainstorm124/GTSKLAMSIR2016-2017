You come from a family of poor peasants. You got a very basic education, and thought of moving to the city. However, you were too poorly educated for factory jobs in nearby cities, so you had to stay in the countryside. When the collectivization drive came, you and your family had to join a collective farm. You are unimpressed by the supposed &quot;improvements&quot; to farming brought on by new technology.
