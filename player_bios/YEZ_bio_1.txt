Nikolai Yezhov came from a relatively poor background, and rose from being a simple factory worker to the People’s Commissar for Internal Affairs in the NKVD. He served in the Red Army during the Russian civil war, and, after working his way up the ranks of the party, rose to political prominence in the 1930s. In 1934, Yezhov was a major figure within the NKVD, and was one of the primary investigators of the Kirov murder.
