Born in the 1890s in a small village in the Saratov Oblast. You come from a family of very poor agricultural workers. After the Civil War, during the NEP era, you envied the peasants in your village who had small independent plots and were allowed to take their produce to sell at the market.  When the collectivization drives started, you were very glad to see these peasants with small independent plots forced to join collectives. Now you feel that the playing field has been leveled out.
